\section{Introduction}
We document Poaky, which is a software component of RobinTrace. Poaky deals
with basic ray-wise and element-wise sequential raytracing operations. Its
goal is to provide a reference implementation and document clearly the
forward simulation pass of sequential raytracing. The simulation is carried
out within the context of geometrical optics.

We had similar endeavours in a previous work \cite{Houllier-thesis}.
The present software is a rewrite of this work after putting more thought and
research into the problem. Much of the present work is ultimately a rehash of
the work of Welford \cite{Welford:1986}, who was foundational in computerized
optical design raytracing.

In its present version, only a handful of operations are implemented. The
current development goal is to reach a minimal working example in RobinTrace.
Whether Poaky will serve as the base layer for RobinTrace in its current state
or merely as a reference is not yet decided.
